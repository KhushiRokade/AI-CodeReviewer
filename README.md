## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note  
This app relies on an AI API with **limited usage per minute**.  
If you repeatedly submit code for review, you may see a **"Resource Exhausted"** error.  
To resolve this:  
- Wait a few minutes and try again.  
- Avoid submitting too many queries in a short time.  

Thank you for understanding!
